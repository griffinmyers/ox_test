ox_test
=======

A test case that shows the Ox Sax Parses seg faulting within a rails app. 

Installation and Running
========================

* `Clone` the repo
* Use Ruby 1.9.3-p125 (at least that's what I used to get the segfault)
* `bundle install`
* `rails s`
* Refresh a few times, wait a minute, refresh a bit more, give it some time, but eventually (generally within 5 minutes), BOOM
